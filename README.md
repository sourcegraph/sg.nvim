sg.nvim is a plugin focused on bringing many of the features of sourcegraph.com and Cody into Neovim.

## Setup

To login, either:

- Run `:SourcegraphLogin` after following installation instructions for `sourcegraph.com` usage.
- Run `:SourcegraphLogin!` and provide an endpoint and access token to be stored.
- Use the `SRC_ENDPOINT` and `SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variables to manage tokens for enterprise usage.
  - See [src-cli](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli#log-into-your-sourcegraph-instance) for more info

See `:help sg.auth` for more information.

You can check that you're logged in by then running `:checkhealth sg`

## Autocomplete

Currently, sg.nvim only supports nvim-cmp and blink.cmp. For setup information, see: `:help cody.complete`.

If you have other completion sources you would like added, please let me know in the issue tracker!

## Installation

### Requirements

Requires:

- nvim 0.9 or nvim nightly
- Node.js >= 18.17.0 (LTS) at runtime for [`cody-agent.js`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/cody)

(By default, sg.nvim downloads released binaries from GitHub. If you prefer to build the plugin yourself, you'll need `cargo` to build)

- Currently uses plenary.nvim and telescope.nvim for some features.
  - If you would like to use something else for search functionality, please make an issue and I can look into adding support.

### Install

Regardless of installation method, you must call `require("sg").setup { ... }` in your config.

" Required if you want to use some of the search functionality
Plug 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'
```
</details>

After installation, run `:checkhealth sg`.

(Nix instructions at the end of the readme)

## Configuration:

```lua
-- Sourcegraph configuration. All keys are optional
require("sg").setup {
  -- Pass your own custom attach function
  --    If you do not pass your own attach function, then the following maps are provide:
  --        - gd -> goto definition
  --        - gr -> goto references
  on_attach = your_custom_lsp_attach_function
}
```

```vim
" Example mapping for doing searches from within neovim (may change) using telescope.
" (requires telescope.nvim to be installed)
nnoremap <space>ss <cmd>lua require('sg.extensions.telescope').fuzzy_search_results()<CR>
```

### Nix(OS)

The project is packaged as a [Nix Flake][nix-flakes]. Consume it as you normally would.
For reference, see:

- [Neovim guide on NixOS wiki](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Neovim)
- [gh:willruggiano/neovim.drv](https://github.com/willruggiano/neovim.drv)

```nix
sg = let
  system = "x86_64-linux";
  package = inputs.sg-nvim.packages.${system}.default;
in {
  inherit package;
  init = pkgs.writeTextFile {
    name = "sg.lua";
    text = ''
      return function()
        package.cpath = package.cpath .. ";" .. "${package}/lib/?.so"
      end
    '';
  };
};
```

For Nix contributors and maintainers:

- Feel free to `nix flake update` every once in a while to make sure `flake.lock` is up-to-date
- [ ] Minimal `sg.nvim`-integrated neovim package for testing and example
- [ ] Integrate `sg.nvim` + Cody onto [nixpkgs:vimPlugins](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/fe2fb24a00ec510d29ccd4e36af72a0c55d81ec0/pkgs/applications/editors/vim/plugins)

## Development

### Loading the plugin
To be able to test our changes we need to tell our favourite plugin manager to load the plugin locally rather than clone it from GitHub. Below is a snippet on how to do it with `lazy.nvim`

```lua
{
  --- The dir specified here is the absolute path to the sg.nvim repository
  dir = "~/code/path-to-sg-nvim-repo",
  dependencies = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" }
}
```

### Dynamically switch to loading the plugin from the repository

For ease for development it can be useful to automatically switch to loading the plugin from this repository if we enter this directory. We can do this by doing the following:

1. In your plugin manager configuration, create the following function

```lua
local function load_sg()
  if vim.env.SG_NVIM_DEV then
    return { dir = vim.fn.getcwd(), dependencies = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" } }
  else
    --- This is the configuration that lazy.nvim expects, but you can change it to whatever configuration your plugin manager expects
    return {
      "sourcegraph/sg.nvim",
      dependencies = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" },
    }
  end
end
```
2. Update your configuration - example (lazy.nvim):

```lua
require("lazy").setup({
  "example/other-plugin",
  load_sg(),
}
```
3. Finally, we need the `SG_NVIM_DEV` variable to exist in our environment as soon as we enter the repository. We can do that by using [direnv](https://direnv.net/) which automatically loads `.envrc` if it exists. Let's edit the current `.envrc`

```bash
export SG_NVIM_DEV="true"
# If nix-shell available, then nix is installed. We're going to use nix-direnv.
# for automatic devshell injection after opt-in `direnv allow`
if command -v nix-shell &> /dev/null
then
    use flake
fi
```

With the above changes, as soon as we enter this repository directory `direnv` will run `.envrc` which exports our `SG_NVIM_DEV` variable. Once we open Neovim and our plugins are loaded our `load_sg` function will get executed and see the `SG_NVIM_DEV` varialbe in the environment and rather load the `sg.nvim` plugin from the current working directory!
