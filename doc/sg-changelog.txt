Sourcegraph Changelog                                             *sg-changelog*

December 14, 2023 - 0.3.0 

Large update relating to new Sourcegraph Authentication Strategies.

- Removed App support (for now, may be added back later)
- Authentication is now stored using `keyring-rs`, which integrates with
  the system keyring storage options.
- Changed authentication strategy:
    - Now will by default use SRC_ENDPOINT and SRC_ACCESS_TOKEN environment
      variables, if available.
    - If they are not available, will check for previously saved credentials
      from |:SourcegraphLogin|
    - If they are not available, will prompt user to get new credentials via
      |:SourcegraphLogin| process
